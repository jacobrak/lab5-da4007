# Small Language Model

The following Program is a implementation of a Small Language Model. It predicts next token prediction using very simple algrothim to find the disturbution of next charcters. Using modern c++.

## Compilation

The software can be compiled simply with the makefile running `$make$` in bash. the expected use should be in this format:

"./output k filename length"

- **output** -- is the .exe file generated by the makefile.  
- **k** -- is the length of the used by the prediction algrothim.  
- **filename** -- is the textfile which you choose to be predicted.  
- **length** -- is the desired output length.

---

## Notes

k should be larger or equal to length. There is no reason to depredict, it will therefore throw an error in case of misuse. 

Typically k should also be of small size because matching is done with exact copies. If no copies are present the program will terminate and no prediction can be done. To circumnavigate this please make k small :). 

Small example if randomlly get a word like "hex" it will predict the next charcter if the entire corpus is just "hej, hex" there is technically no charcter to predict. This can also happen if impossible combinations are generated, this usually happens with large k and a small textfile. 

Only the last \n charcter will be removed.

## Example

example use:

./output 2 hubba_bubba.txt 20

output:

bba bubba bubba bubb
